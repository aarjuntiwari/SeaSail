        </hgroup>
        <p>This is a fun, exciting game where 100 players get on their pirate ships and sail in search of treasure. To win, you must be the last pirate standing with the most treasure. Will you emerge as the best pirate?

        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>Use the Left and Right Arrow keys to move either... well, you guessed it, left or right! The Down Arrow key helps you slide/dive under obstacles, while the Up Arrow key helps you see at a different angle. Press the Z key to aim, the R key to run, the S key to sprint, the A key to shoot, and the Spacebar key to jump. </p>
        <h3>Coming Soon</h3>
        <p>SeaSail's first ever season will be released on June 21, 2025. This season will make your summer filled with pirate adventures! </p>

          <h2>Season 1 "The Summer Seas"</h2>
          <h3>It's summertime! The sun is out, and the seas are filled with pirates lurking for treasure! The sea is calm for now, but as the season comes to an end, the seas will become stormy and dangerous with a supreme final boss battle, where instead of fighting with other pirates, you will work with other pirates to defeat the final boss. <pi></pi>   </h3>
